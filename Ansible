Configuration management is the process of handling changes to a system in a way that assures integrity over time,
typically involving tools and processes that facilitate automation and observability. 


Ansible Overview :
  - Ansible is a agentless modern configuration management tool that facilitates the task of setting up and maintaining remote servers, storage, 
    networking, and software with a minimalist design intended to get users up and running quickly.
  - Users write Ansible provisioning scripts in YAML, a user-friendly data serialization standard that is not tied to 
    any particular programming language. This enables users to create sophisticated provisioning scripts more intuitively compared to similar tools in the same category.
  - Ansible doesnâ€™t require any special software to be installed on the nodes that will be managed with this tool.
    A control machine is set up with the Ansible software, which then communicates with the nodes via standard SSH on linux and vinrm on windows.

Control node : where ansible is installd
Manage node : on which action are perform by ansible

Inventory file :  it  defines the hosts and groups of hosts so you can run automation tasks on multiple hosts at the same time.
  - you can create group of manage nodes in inventory
      [groupname]
      Manage node
      Manage node

ad hoc commands :
  - An Ansible ad hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes.
  - ad hoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not reusable. 
  -  syntax : $ ansible [pattern] -m [module] -a "[module options]"


cmd:
-m : module
-a : argument
ansible-playbook -i inventory <Adhoc command or Playbook.yml>
ansible -i inventory.ini -m shell -a "apt install openjdk" all
