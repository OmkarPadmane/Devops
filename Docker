Docker
- Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
- It allows developers to package their applications and all their dependencies into a single container.
- A consistent environment is provided by docker so that the software can run across multiple computing environments. 

Containers:
- A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, secure, executable package of software that 
includes everything needed to run an application for ex. code, system tools, system libraries and settings.
- These containers encapsulate the dependencies of an application and make sure that it is consistent across multiple environments. 
- It can run on any computer, no matter how different they are, because it brings its own special environment with it.

- why docker containers are lightweight?
  -- Docker containers are lightweight because they only contain the application and its parameters,
  and not the entire operating system. Containers share the machine's OS system kernel and therefore
  they do not require an OS per application.
